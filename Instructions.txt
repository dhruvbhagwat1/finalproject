Instructions for excecution of files:


For parallel implementation:

    We compile the files using:  
            
            mpicc -o nqueen nqueen.c

    We then run the excecutable using: 
            
            mpirun -n (number of cores) ./nqueen

(The parallel implementation does not prompt to enter the value of n, after excecution, enter n and the program will run.)




For serial implementation:

    We compile the files using:  

            gcc -o nqueen-serial nqueen_serial.c

    We then run the excecutable using: 

            ./nqueen_serial
